# Quark CLI

With this CLI, you can use this to create a cross-framework/tech stack component, or perhaps you can package it as an npm package for distribution for others to use.

English | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

```tsx
import { QuarkElement, customElement } from 'quarkc'

@customElement({
  tag: 'my-component',
})
class MyComponent extends QuarkElement {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello Quark!</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Use it as a normal html element in various frameworks (React/Vue/Angular/JQ):

```html
<my-component></my-component>
```

## Examples of usage scenarios

Increase efficiency and reduce cost for your project/team！

Quark-CLI allows you to develop business components across multiple technology stacks/frameworks directly in daily development. For example, a marketing pop-up window of the same style can do:

- Running in front-end projects of different technology stacks (Angular, Vue, React, etc.) at the same time
- Run in different versions of the technology stack at the same time, such as running in Vue2.x, Vue3.x at the same time
